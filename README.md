# Project: TMDB Box Office Prediction

The TMDB Box Office Prediction project is aimed at exlporing the possibilities of building modes to predict movie revenue in the motion picture industry. With the industry experiencing rapid growth globally, it is important to develop accurate models that can provide insights to increase revenue.

## Data Set

The project uses the TMDB Box Office Prediction data set which contains information about various movies including their budget, genres, cast, release date, popularity and revenue.

## Methodology

The project uses exploratory data analysis (EDA) and feature engineering to gain insights from the data set. For data visualization, we primarily use Plotly Python, which is Plotly's Python graphing library that creates interactive, publication-quality graphs that are ready for both online and offline use.

## Goal

The main goal of this project is to build models that accurately predict movie revenue. The results from these models can be used to further increase revenue in the motion picture industry. By the end of the project, we aim to answer the following questions:

    • What are the key factors that affect a movie's revenue?
    • Which machine learning models perform best in predicting movie revenue?

## Tools and Libraries

The project uses the following tools and libraries:

    • Python programming language
    • Jupyter notebook
    • Plotly Python library
    • Pandas library
    • Numpy library
    • Matplotlib library
    • Scikit-learn library
